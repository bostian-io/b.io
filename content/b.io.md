I am an American digital nomad with experience designing and building AI products from initial concept to beta stage and aligning execution with technical and business goals and objectives. There are currently two shiny new generative AI products in the pipeline which will be released soon. I have spent the better part of the last two years dedicated to this.

In a past life I was a portrait photographer and worked in sales. If you want to learn more about my personal and professional interests, you can read about that [here](/posts).

This is my personal technical blog and website. It is meant to serve broadly as ["exhaust"](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public) for my learning and growth efforts and as a useful resource for my networking efforts. Please reach out if you have any thoughts you want to share, just want to connect, or would like to work together. I would love to hear from you and sincerely hope the information here helps you in some way.
